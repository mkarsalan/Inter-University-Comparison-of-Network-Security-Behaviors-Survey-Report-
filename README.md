# Inter University Comparison of Network Security Behaviors Survey Report

Abstract:

We apply the previously proposed Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) and Revised Security Behavior Intentions Scale (RSeBIS) to a population sample of 221 students. First, we test the validity of both the scales then send RSeBIS to different universities to get in depth comparison. We then build a model to compare the security behaviors and find that participants from different universities exhibit different behavior. For instance, participants from LUMS had the most diverse security behavior while the participants from FAST had the most secure online practices. Most of the students are aware of security risk involved when using the internet but they choose not to do anything about it.
